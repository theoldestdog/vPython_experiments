I've been experimenting with the kinematics equations for projectiles both with and without drag.
Animating the results provides support for the values calculated by the equations during a trial.
The starting point is a launch angle of 45' since this represents the optimum launch angle for displacement
in example w/o drag so provides an easy means of testing the equations since similarly different launch angles 
should be symmetrical about the 45' outcomes. E.g 30' and 60' launches should fall the same distance from the 45'
launch both - and +
